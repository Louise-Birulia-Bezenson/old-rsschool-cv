## Personal information
 Now my priority is education. I spend a lot of time on self-study and also study with a tutor and take online courses. At the previous place of work, the ability to study independently helped me to quickly grow up the career ladder.<br/> I started my career as a junior analyst, worked hard and asked for additional tasks, as a result, after 2 years I took the position of director of marketing.<br/>
 I am very sociable, so it was easy for me to manage the team. In addition to management, my tasks included: analysis of the market and marketing indicators, distribution of the budget of advertising companies, implementation of automatic sales funnels, a set of financial statements and communication with the franchisee.
